This is my project following the guidelines set by Udacity's Readables Redux course, consisting of a content and comment web app. Users can view, comment and vote on posts. They also have the ability to edit or delete posts and comments.

The backend code was written and provided by Udacity and the frontend was started with the create-react-app template
